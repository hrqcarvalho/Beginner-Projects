# Beginner Projects

> Here I am gathering all the beginner projects from a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

I am taking a course called _"100 days of code"_ taught by Dr. Angela Yu, and it basically consists in the Dr. explaining small concepts of the language **Python** at a time and then proposing a project for each one.

The funny part is as you progress through the course the projects will become more and more complex until you be doing professional level projects; Having said that, here I thought _"Why not gather all the beginner projects in one place? They are way too simple anyway, so I guess they won't crash anything..."_  and this is why I choose to do just one repository for these projects.

## The list of projects here:
- Band Name Generator
    - A program that takes the city you grew up in and your pet's name and return a name for your band.
- Tip Calculator
    - A program that takes a value, tip's percentage and a number of people and return the splitted bill.
